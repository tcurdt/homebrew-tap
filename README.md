```

Wait until the pull requestâ€™s checks become green. Then label your pull request with the pr-pull label (this is the default label that will trigger the uploading workflow; you can easily change this in workflow file). A new brew pr-pull workflow will be fired up and after a couple of minutes you should observe the PR closed, bottles uploaded and commits pushed to the main branch of your repository.
